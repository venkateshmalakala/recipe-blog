## 🚀 Features

* **🌍 Multilingual Support:** Full content localization in **English (en)**, **Spanish (es)**, and **French (fr)**. The UI and content switch dynamically based on the user's preference.
* **⚡ Static Site Generation (SSG):** Homepage and individual recipe pages are pre-rendered at build time for lightning-fast Time-to-First-Byte (TTFB) and superior SEO.
* **🔍 Client-Side Search & Filter:** Instant search capabilities and category filtering on the `/recipes` page without server round-trips.
* **📱 Responsive & Professional UI:** A mobile-first design built with **Tailwind CSS**, featuring a clean Slate & Emerald color palette.
* **🖼️ Optimized Media:** Automatic image optimization using `next/image` to prevent layout shifts and reduce bandwidth.
* **🐳 Fully Containerized:** A production-ready Docker setup that builds the app and serves it on port 3000.
* **📡 SEO Best Practices:** Automatic `sitemap.xml` generation and dynamic metadata for social sharing (OpenGraph/Twitter Cards).
* **🖨️ Print Optimization:** Specific print styles to hide navigation and footers when printing recipes.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Design Decisions

### 1. Rendering Strategy: Static Site Generation (SSG)
We chose **SSG** (`getStaticProps` / `getStaticPaths`) for the **Homepage** and **Recipe Details** pages.
* **Reasoning:** Recipe content is relatively static and does not change frequently. Pre-rendering these pages ensures the best possible performance and SEO ranking.
* **Implementation:** Pages are generated at build time. ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration) can be easily enabled via the `revalidate` prop if content updates become more frequent.

### 2. Client-Side Search vs. Server-Side Search
The **All Recipes** page (`/recipes`) fetches all recipe data at build time but handles searching and filtering in the browser.
* **Reasoning:** For a typical blog with hundreds of recipes, client-side filtering provides an **instant** user experience (0ms latency). It avoids the overhead of making API calls to the server for every keystroke.

### 3. Internationalization (i18n) Strategy
We utilize a hybrid approach for translations:
* **Static UI Text:** Managed via `public/locales/*.json` files using `next-i18next`. This keeps the codebase clean and separates content from code.
* **Dynamic Content:** Fetched directly from Contentful's **Localization API**. This allows content editors to manage translations for recipes (Ingredients, Instructions) without developer intervention.

### 4. Headless CMS Integration
We decoupled the frontend from the backend using **Contentful**.
* **Reasoning:** This allows for a flexible content model where recipes, authors, and categories are managed independently of the presentation layer. It supports the "Jamstack" architecture.

## 📦 Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to get the application running locally using Docker.

### Prerequisites
* [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed and running.
* Git installed.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/venkateshmalakala/recipe-blog.git
cd recipe-blog

```

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

The application requires connection details for Contentful. Create a `.env.local` file based on the example.

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local

```

Open `.env.local` and populate it with your credentials:

```ini
# CMS Provider
CMS_PROVIDER='contentful'

# Contentful API Credentials
CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID='your_space_id'
CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN='your_delivery_token' # Content Delivery API Token
CONTENTFUL_PREVIEW_ACCESS_TOKEN='your_preview_token'

```

*> **Note:** `.env.local` is ignored by git to protect your secrets.*

### Step 3: Run with Docker

Start the application using Docker Compose. This command builds the image and starts the container.

```bash
docker-compose up --build

```

### Step 4: Access the Application

Once the terminal shows "Ready", open your browser:

* **App:** [http://localhost:3000](https://www.google.com/search?q=http://localhost:3000)
* **Sitemap:** [http://localhost:3000/sitemap.xml](https://www.google.com/search?q=http://localhost:3000/sitemap.xml)
